#### 1 <i>What does this contain?</i>
This includes all of my day to day bash scripts that I use on the terminal. Some may include custom codes that I have created. All of these files are in my /usr/bin file. The way that I make these scripts usable is by using the command *sudo chmod +x filename* in the terminal. This allows the script permissions to be run in the /usr/bin file as commands.
